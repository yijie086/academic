The development of a TeV-scale muon accelerator and storage ring provides enormous scientific potential not only for a mu+mu- collider, but also for deep inelastic scattering in a completely new regime when a TeV muon beam collides with a hadron beam. For example, if the approved Electron-Ion Collider at BNL were eventually upgraded with a TeV muon beam replacing its low-energy electron ring, a Q^2 reach of up to 10^6 GeV^2 is accessible and a parton momentum fraction x down to 10^{-5} can be probed. This coverage is equivalent to that of the proposed LHeC. Therefore, such a facility is of great interest to both particle and nuclear physics communities.

We report on studies of the physics potential at such muon-ion colliders that could be realized at the BNL facility. In particular, we discuss that the sensitivity to very low values of x will allow a careful study of the expected region of gluon saturation in proton and nuclei. And we believe MuIC has the potential for precision QCD measurement. We also examine the potential for F2 structural function studies in muon-proton collisions through calculations of the production cross sections for different x and Q2.
