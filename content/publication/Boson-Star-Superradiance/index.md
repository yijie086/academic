abstract: Recently, it has been realized that in some systems internal space rotation can induce energy amplification for scattering waves, similar to rotation in real space. Particularly, it has been shown that energy extraction is possible for a Q-ball, a stationary non-topological soliton that is coherently rotating in its field space. In this paper, we generalize the analysis to the case of boson stars, and show that the same energy extraction mechanism still works for boson stars.
