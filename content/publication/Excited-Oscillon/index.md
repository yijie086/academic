abstract: Two types of excited oscillons are investigated. We first focus on
  spherical symmetry and find that there are a tower of spherical oscillons with
  higher energies. Despite having multiple approximate "nodes" in their energy
  density profiles, these oscillons are long-lived. We find that during the
  lifetime of a highly excited oscillon it will cascade down all the lower
  energy levels before its disintegration. We also point out the existence of
  excited oscillons with higher approximate multipoles, which generally have
  shorter lifespans than the spherical ones. Apart from performing nonlinear
  simulations with absorbing boundary conditions, we also apply a perturbative
  method to analyze some features of these excited oscillons.
