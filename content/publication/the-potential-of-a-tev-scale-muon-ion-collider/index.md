abstract: We propose the development of a novel muon-proton and muon-nucleus
  collider facility at the TeV scale that is capable of performing precision
  deep inelastic scattering measurements in new regimes and providing a rich
  program in nuclear and particle physics. Such a facility could seed, or
  leverage, the development of a muon-antimuon collider and make use of the
  existing hadron accelerator infrastructure when sited at a facility such as
  Brookhaven National Laboratory, Fermilab, or CERN. We discuss the possible
  energy and luminosity design parameters for several collider configurations,
  and illustrate the science potential with several studies on deep inelastic
  scattering kinematics, Higgs and vector boson production, top quark
  production, and beyond Standard Model leptoquark production. Detector design
  considerations and a possible road map toward development are also given.
