abstract: Recently, it has been realized that in some systems internal space
  rotation can induce energy amplification for scattering waves, similar to
  rotation in real space. Particularly, it has been shown that energy extraction
  is possible for a Q-ball, a stationary non-topological soliton that is
  coherently rotating in its field space. In this paper, we generalize the
  analysis to the case of boson stars, and show that the same energy extraction
  mechanism still works for boson stars.
